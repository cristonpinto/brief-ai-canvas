1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,380
Did you think we abandoned you?

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,900
Or that we'd run out of magic? Well, think again, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,940
because you are about to be amazed.

4
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,940
If you're here right now, then you have followed the clues and cracked the

5
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,980
code. Congratulations and welcome.

6
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,280
It's been 10 years since the Horsemen last appeared, but we are back.

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,080
Okay, so come in close.

8
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,840
Closer. Because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to dress up

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,920
old tricks and fool you that they are new.

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,320
So, my name is J.

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,280
Daniel Atlas.

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,120
And allow me to speak, as I often do for my less charismatic colleagues,

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,280
when I say it is very good to be back.

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,720
Yes, yes, we vanished for a while.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,500
But in the world of magic, everything that disappears reappears.

16
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,500
Well, at least if the trick is done right.

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,940
I'm Mayor McKinnon.

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,540
Unlike my very good buddy here, Danny, most of you checked your egos at the

19
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,500
door tonight.

20
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,460
You found this little underground soiree because you wanted to get fooled.

21
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,300
Hey, everyone, I'm Jack Wilder.

22
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,590
Ward Pandemics.

23
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,550
Climate change.

24
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,870
AI, let's face it.

25
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,030
We all need magic more than ever.

26
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,550
I want you to pay very close attention.

27
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,590
You are not gonna want to miss this next trick.

28
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,430
Henley Reeves.

29
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,070
Now, Henley Reeves Scanlan.

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,910
Three kids, two dogs, and a master's degree.

31
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,190
It's been a while.

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,630
Did you miss us?

33
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,390
You guys were great.

34
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,740
Back in the.

35
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,730
I used to want to be a magician.

36
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,490
Then I turned 12.

37
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,250
Careful. They might be listening.

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,490
Ooh, I'm shaking in my.

39
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,170
All Saints.

40
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,730
What are they going to do? Is that real gold? What? Is that real gold? Yeah.

41
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,930
I'm rich.

42
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,010
This is a magic show, dude.

43
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,850
Every fool here is a pickpocket, or pickpocket's fool.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,360
Was that a haiku? What was that? Each of you just received a playing card.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,760
If you wouldn't mind pulling it out.

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,920
Great. Now, we're gonna shuffle the deck so everybody find a random person

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,120
near them and switch cards with them.

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,560
And then when you've done that, find somebody else and switch with them.

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,160
Okay? Great.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Now, you there.

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,120
Down there.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
Yep. What is your card? Ace of diamonds.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,600
Ace of diamonds.

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,040
Okay, let's make things a little more complicated here.

55
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Does anybody else here have the ace of diamonds meets me? Ace of diamonds.

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,320
Oh, looks like we have a fifth horseman, not named Lula, come up on stage.

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,880
You're gonna be our helper.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Now, look into my eyes and sleep.

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,520
Still got it.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,380
Now, this might look an ordinary kid to you, but tonight he is going to do

61
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,140
extraordinary magic.

62
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,380
Like a man possessed.

63
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:21,260
Literally. Henley? Yes, Mary? Would you mind stepping Inside his body? Yep.

64
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,660
And, Jack, why don't you throw yourself on in there, too? What I do best.

65
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:35,820
And, oh, God help you, Atlas, why don't you slither on inside as well? And I

66
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,880
might as well wedge myself in there, too.

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,520
It takes a village to make magic.

68
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,120
J. Daniel Atlas in the house.

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,200
So, who wants to see a magic trick?

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,120
Take it away, Merit.

71
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,550
Hello, you beautiful people.

72
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,500
Now, everyone knows that merit McKenna reads minds.

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,980
Well, now I'm him or he's me.

74
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,700
Who knows? I'm sensing someone came here tonight not to enjoy magic, but to

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,460
tear it down.

76
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,420
Is there a Brett Finnegan in the house?

77
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,910
Now, you and your friends here set up the camp Hobart crypto exchange.

78
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,390
Took the good people of New York's employee pension and welfare fund half

79
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,150
its cash.

80
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,830
You're rounding up.

81
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,750
And also, the risks were laid out very clearly.

82
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,870
Everybody knew what they were getting into.

83
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:56,210
Dude, did you hide the profits offshore? Count ending in 5, 3, 2, 9, 7.

84
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,170
You couldn't know that without my.

85
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:07,410
Oh, is this real gold? Rhett, you ought to be more careful with your things,

86
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,210
man. Amerit's a psychic.

87
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,570
But me, Jack, I'm in the sleight of hand.

88
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,930
Ask your friends.

89
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,170
They've just done their part to close the wealth gap.

90
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,970
Now, here's a little redistribution.

91
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,550
Thank you.

92
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,070
Thank you.

93
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,950
Fire up, dude.

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,670
I'll kick your ass.

95
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,790
Oh, someone forgot Henley can fly.

96
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,990
We can take it from here, But a round of applause for the best sportsman on

97
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,390
stage.

98
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,310
Fantastic. So, everybody, I want you to take your drink and I want you to

99
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,830
pour it onto the face of your card.

100
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,430
Can you do that? Those 12 unique words on each of your cards form the

101
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,550
password to your new crypto wallet.

102
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,150
Oh. Log on and you'll find Brent's stolen millions more fairly

103
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,030
redistributed. Oh, my God.

104
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,190
50. 50,000 bucks.

105
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,630
50,000,

106
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,830
you're freaking done, dude.

107
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,880
Cool your head, gingerbread, cuz I am having a vision.

108
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,200
Maybe cops are going to come bursting through that door to perform a magic

109
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,880
trick of your own.

110
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,960
And disappear in 3, 2, 1.

111
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,730
Now, come in close.

112
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,130
Closer. Because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to dress up

113
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,210
old tricks and fool you that they are new.

114
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,650
Oh, my God.

115
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,010
No,

116
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,230
look, in my opinion, I think you did a great job.

117
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,110
I think my atlas was good.

118
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,590
My merit could probably use some work.

119
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,390
It's like San Diego stoner and a shrimp boat captain out of Vegas.

120
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,790
Sure. No, seriously, Bosco, I don't know how you do it.

121
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,350
A good impersonation isn't just about the mimicry it's about attention to

122
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,310
detail, personality and nuance.

123
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,030
Okay, okay.

124
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,390
Let me try.

125
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:46,830
Let me try.

126
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,630
I am J.

127
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,430
Daniel. Alex.

128
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,380
The closer you look, the less you see.

129
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,660
There's something.

130
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,740
Yep. You'll work on it.

131
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,300
It wasn't bad.

132
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,180
It's a good start, but could use some work.

133
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,660
Sure. What do you keep looking at? Nothing.

134
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,460
Cheer up, guys.

135
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,540
Come on, look at us.

136
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,940
Look at how far we've been.

137
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,420
Totally scored tonight.

138
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
All right, next time, you wear the pink wig, okay? No, dude, it's locked

139
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,980
again. Okay, I'll pick it.

140
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,660
Wait, wait, wait.

141
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,020
Hold on.

142
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,660
Do the thing.

143
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,180
No. Please, do the thing.

144
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,980
It's so cool.

145
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,550
I'll hold your back.

146
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,900
So unnecessary.

147
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,540
It's fun.

148
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,180
Hey,

149
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,020
you got this.

150
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,460
She's like a little Mario.

151
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,980
She is like Mario.

152
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,100
Careful, careful.

153
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,340
You okay? Yeah.

154
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,980
If I could do that, I would only do that.

155
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,110
So cool.

156
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,830
It's insane.

157
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,470
Happy? Yeah.

158
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,150
That was awesome.

159
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,110
Please let us in.

160
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,750
It's cold.

161
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,750
Best apartment in the whole city.

162
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,470
Yup. And no one will ever see it but us.

163
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,990
Such a shame.

164
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,640
That guy is so screwed.

165
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,800
Who's rich now? Charlie, can you turn that thing off, please? I think I've

166
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,080
had enough Atlas for one night.

167
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah, I gotcha.

168
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
Bosco, can you check for pizza? I'm so hungry.

169
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,560
Me, too.

170
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
No pizza.

171
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,560
But we got beer and.

172
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,400
No, literally, just beer.

173
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,250
Any takers? Yeah, I'll have one.

174
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
Dude, seriously, turn that thing off.

175
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,920
I did.

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,280
Okay, real funny, guys.

177
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,920
Where's the other projector? I'm not a hologram.

178
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm not a hologram.

179
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,960
Right. Yes, exactly what a hologram would say.

180
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,200
Oh, my God, you're real.

181
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
Never touch my face again.

182
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm so sorry.

183
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
I thought that you were a hologram.

184
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,680
I would never do that.

185
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm a huge fan of yours.

186
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,920
How are you? How did you find us? I don't know.

187
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,280
Took me about 30 seconds.

188
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,920
And if it was this easy for me to find you, how hard would it be for the

189
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,180
police? Well, hold on.

190
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,820
The police? Yeah, the police.

191
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,740
Why would the police be looking for us? I don't know.

192
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,740
What about that little heist you just pulled? Or the fact that you're

193
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,820
squatting in this place so that your electricity comes from the circuit box

194
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
in the corner? I don't know.

195
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,380
It could be anything.

196
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,420
Am I right, Bozo? Bosco.

197
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,700
Bosco Leroy.

198
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,940
That's right.

199
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,340
Yeah, Bosco Leroy.

200
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,380
What did you type fictional magician name into? ChatGPT? Oh, that's actually

201
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,100
my real name.

202
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,020
Atlas. Would your mom have sex with a map? That's not funny.

203
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,620
You don't know anything about us? Dude, I know everything about you.

204
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,180
The dubiously named Bosco Laroi, promising acting career cut short by

205
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,380
crippling student loans.

206
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,740
It's a bummer you had to drop out of Juilliard, but you never stopped

207
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,220
performing. If.

208
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,700
If memory serves, your last paid gig, I think, was dressing as Elmo in Times

209
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,100
Square. First of all, I have the number.

210
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,190
Elmo the Red Teletubby.

211
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,670
Po. The Red Teletubby.

212
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,910
Her name is Po.

213
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,950
She's my favorite one.

214
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,110
Her name is Poe.

215
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:09,270
Cute. And you, June McClair, kicked out of every boarding school your

216
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,470
parents forced you to attend.

217
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,390
Not a big fan of authority, I take it.

218
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,670
Let me guess.

219
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,510
You think the olds broke the planet, and it's your generation's duty to

220
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,230
clean up their mess.

221
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,520
Am I right? Am I wrong? No.

222
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,240
And so you ran away from home, made your way to New York, where you ran into

223
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,640
this guy at Tannen's Magic Shop.

224
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,600
Charlie Geese.

225
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,280
Yeah, hi.

226
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, hi.

227
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,960
I actually couldn't find a lot about you online.

228
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,280
Although I do know you were an orphan.

229
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,920
I knew you were in and out of foster care your entire childhood and that you

230
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,080
didn't know the meaning of family until you hooked up with these two.

231
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,040
And so the three of you have been working your little Robin Hood act for

232
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,240
years now, trying to change the world one trick at a time, all leading to

233
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,370
your riskiest theft to date.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,640
My identity.

235
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,520
You were there.

236
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,600
You had our faces plastered on every scaffolding and subway stop in the

237
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
city. That's copyright infringement, by the way.

238
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,960
Of course I was there.

239
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,360
So, what'd you think? I think your merit needs work.

240
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,880
I knew it.

241
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,920
That's a sensitive topic.

242
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,640
You don't even get it.

243
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,440
But overall design was impressive.

244
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,600
And that's you, I assume.

245
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,280
The quiet guy.

246
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,600
Textbook behind the scenes.

247
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,920
Yeah, Alexander Herman.

248
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,520
He said that the people who designed his tricks were the real geniuses.

249
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,430
The fact that you know that man's name behind the scenes, clearly.

250
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,390
And you, your sleight of hand was advanced.

251
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,150
Good dexterity.

252
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,230
You're quick and nimble on your feet.

253
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,990
Really? I was impressed.

254
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,030
Thanks. You're welcome.

255
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,870
Sounds like we're pretty great.

256
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,150
You're far from it.

257
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,110
But maybe with a little fine tuning, you could be.

258
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,870
Yeah, I could.

259
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,470
I could see why the eyes sent me to you.

260
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,110
I'm sorry, did you say the Eye? Yeah, the Eye.

261
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,670
All right, listen.

262
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,870
This card arrived at my apartment three weeks ago, along with four plane

263
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,270
tickets and instructions hidden in the lining for a trick bigger and better

264
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,550
than anything you have ever seen.

265
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,950
A trick that, for some reason, includes the three of you.

266
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,630
Us? Why not the other Horsemen? The other Horsemen are dead.

267
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,270
What? To me? They're dead to me.

268
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,030
Stop interrupting.

269
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,630
No. Things got emotional.

270
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,350
Everyone quit.

271
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,470
I took a walk about in Australia.

272
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,270
It's a long story.

273
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,190
And now you need us.

274
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,190
According to that card, yes.

275
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,640
Well, we don't need you.

276
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
So, Bosco, what.

277
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,760
What do we need this guy for? We're crushing it.

278
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,560
You're crushing it? You're stealing a little money from some crypto, bro.

279
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,200
I am talking about big fish here, man.

280
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm talking about something that will make a real difference.

281
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,680
I thought that's what you kids are all about.

282
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,120
It is.

283
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,800
No. Exactly.

284
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,519
Yes, we are.

285
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,680
Yeah. But I think we can catch our own fish.

286
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,600
You can? No.

287
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,720
No. Good luck with that.

288
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,000
What? No.

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,720
Can you just wait one second? What are you doing? What's.

290
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,610
What's going on? Are you out of your mind? Mind bling.

291
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,250
This is J.

292
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,210
Daniel Atlas.

293
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,410
Yeah, I know who he is.

294
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,890
He's a freaking legend.

295
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,690
He was a legend.

296
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,930
Now he's just kind of a dick.

297
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,570
Can you.

298
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,690
Sure, Bosco, he is kind of a dick, but he is a horseman.

299
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,490
I mean, come on.

300
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,690
Just trust us on this.

301
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,250
Please. Okay.

302
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,170
Decision time, kids.

303
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,610
What's it going to be? Are you in or are you out?

304
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,180
What's the trick?

305
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,380
Welcome esteemed community members, valued press friends and colleagues.

306
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,780
We are gathered here tonight to celebrate Vanderburg's latest and greatest

307
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,180
mind. C3.

308
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,450
Or as we like to call her, Mahle Zulu, for the beautiful one.

309
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,450
Because every child is beautiful in the eyes of its mother.

310
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,490
Our customer can rest assured that when they buy the world's greatest symbol

311
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,210
of love, that it was produced with nothing but.

312
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,590
Welcome. Thank you all so much for making the trip out here.

313
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,030
Now, I take it you were all impressed by Amal.

314
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,710
Sorry, C3.

315
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,550
Oh, it's quite dramatic.

316
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,750
But I also understand that you have chosen this fine day to broach some

317
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,670
concerns which, contrary to your expectations, I don't begrudge.

318
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,030
Fire away.

319
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:13,900
Right. Well, the board field set projections might be optimistic with

320
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,540
increasing competition from lab grown and in the event, borrowing rates.

321
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,860
William, my father loved you.

322
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,780
But there was a reason he called you his dark cloud.

323
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,259
Oh, shame the Vanderburgh family does not lose.

324
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,140
As you're well aware, our motorsports team just won the Monaco championship

325
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,580
for the seventh time.

326
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,380
The man will produce.

327
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,710
Yes. Next, right? Pricing the minimums that you've set.

328
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,830
Will you humor me, William, in a demonstration about reality? This diamond

329
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:56,510
is, say what, 35 carats the AWDC would price it at US$3 million.

330
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:05,000
William, will you open your mouth and stick out your tongue? Now.

331
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,880
Really. Really.

332
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,760
Now, if William here were to swallow it, that selfsame diamond would tear

333
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,080
his throat to shreds.

334
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,440
He would bleed to death before paramedics arrived.

335
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,730
So, to the AWDC, it's 3 million.

336
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,210
But to William, priceless.

337
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,290
Tell me then, as the CEO responsible for the world's last great diamond

338
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,490
mines, should I undercut our profits or should I choose prices that I know

339
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,290
our unique clients will pay?

340
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,770
As I thought.

341
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:02,980
Now, unless there are more concerns, I would like to head to Antwerp with my

342
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,460
price list and show off our stones.

343
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh, you know, you probably could have led with free trip to Europe.

344
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,580
You know, little known fact about Antwerp.

345
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,060
Oh, great, more magic trivia.

346
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,420
This is fun.

347
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,430
No, just going to say that they make great biscuits.

348
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,630
Oh, do they? Can we actually get some, please, On Atlas, obviously.

349
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,270
No, no, I'm not getting you biscuits.

350
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,110
I just got you chocolates.

351
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,070
Okay, all right, listen, this is not a vacation, okay? We have three days to

352
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,630
prepare an effect that'll make your barely passable peppers Ghost Rift look

353
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,510
like a cave painting.

354
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,270
All right, come here.

355
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,670
The Heart Diamond.

356
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,030
The most valuable jewel in history and the foundation of the Vanderburg

357
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,060
Mining Corporation.

358
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,660
Now, for years, the families kept this big rock hidden inside their secret

359
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,020
vault, 70 stories underground.

360
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,020
And not just any ground.

361
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,020
The Arabian desert.

362
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,460
No one beyond.

363
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,530
Their most trusted team has been inside access through a single elevator,

364
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,610
constantly monitored by armed guards,

365
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,770
and behind a multi level biometric security system.

366
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,570
But the world will be watching.

367
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,360
Because for the first time in half a a century, that diamond is being

368
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,600
traveled here to Antwerp to establish credibility and to spur bidding at a

369
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
private auction for the company's latest finds in three days time.

370
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,400
Okay, obviously I'm down for stealing, but what makes this diamond so

371
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,360
special? Oh, because the magical Tarot card told us to.

372
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,800
J. Right.

373
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,480
Okay, that's very cute, but can I please finish? You don't finish.

374
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
Jeez, you've been talking forever.

375
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,040
Yes, and I'm about to talk more, so please pay attention.

376
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,210
For decades, first Peter Vandenberg, now his daughter Veronica, have been

377
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,130
selling these diamonds at inflated prices to arms dealers, traffickers,

378
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,290
warlords the world over to like, help launder their money.

379
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,890
So, I mean, the cash is dirty.

380
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,210
I mean, in some cases it's like literally blood soaked.

381
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,930
But then, voila, it's cleaned.

382
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,570
In exchange for these precious stones, she makes all the world's worst

383
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,290
people possible.

384
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,730
So whoever sent that tarot card are the few truly honorable people left in

385
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,050
this world.

386
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,370
The only people that still care about justice.

387
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,560
The people I haven't spoken to in a long time, they call themselves the Eye.

388
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,920
And they want us to do something that the Horsemen never could.

389
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,960
This man.

390
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,800
This is a chance to drive a stake through the heart of the devil herself.

391
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,920
Let's do it.

392
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,320
All eyes will be on me and the Heart tonight at the auction.

393
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,760
I have to look dazzling.

394
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,160
Do you have that kitten? Kiss.

395
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,600
Color.

396
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,850
The tower.

397
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,490
Yes. Straw.

398
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,970
Who's that? British photographer from Vanity Fair.

399
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,770
What's his name again? Mark.

400
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,770
Mark Scriber.

401
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,890
Schreiber. Good God.

402
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,210
Confirm him.

403
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,130
Cancel the others.

404
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,490
We went wide last year.

405
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,050
This year.

406
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,450
Exclusivity. All right, we're open.

407
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,770
Transparent. We have nothing to hide.

408
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,690
Okay, perfect.

409
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,610
I'll have it done.

410
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,250
This is Veronica.

411
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,780
Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

412
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,300
Who is this?

413
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,500
How did you get this number?

414
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,140
This is a private line.

415
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,460
And that was a bit tone deaf.

416
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,100
I asked who you are.

417
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,590
Veronica. The storage unit to your left.

418
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,630
Look familiar? That belonged to that boy who died 15 years ago.

419
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,070
This means nothing to me.

420
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,470
Or anyone, really.

421
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,510
You and I both know what you did.

422
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,840
Look, if you have real evidence and you're out to get me, why not just use

423
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,480
it? Fifteen years ago, you took what your father loved most.

424
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,520
Now I'm going to do the same to you.

425
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,160
I want the hot diamond.

426
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,760
You're going to give it to me or I'm going to hold up a looking glass for

427
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,880
the whole world to see you as you are.

428
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:39,730
Go ahead.

429
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,890
I have nothing to hide.

430
00:22:59,170 --> 00:22:59,970
Oh, my God.

431
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,170
I'm so sorry about that.

432
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,340
Hi. Can you help me find this? I've been looking for, literally for an hour.

433
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,700
Yes, it's going to be right over there.

434
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,100
Ma'. Am.

435
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,900
Mark Schreiber.

436
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,140
James Wynn Vanderberg.

437
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,260
Pr. Huge admirer of your work, James.

438
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,290
What about Danny? Oh, Danny.

439
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,960
Yet, sadly, we had to let her go.

440
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,400
Turns out she was racist.

441
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,960
And also she booked you into the Radisson Blue in a partial view.

442
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,120
Double, thankfully.

443
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,240
I took the liberty of moving you to the front.

444
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,040
I do not lef.

445
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,840
Yes, the residential suite is befitting of, well, presidents and talented

446
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,000
photographers like yourself.

447
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Your gal invitation has been rerouted.

448
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,190
If I could just check your confirmation.

449
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,830
Thank you.

450
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,790
I also bumped your shoe from 7 to 9pm to give you proper time to make your

451
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,070
magic. Someone gets it.

452
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,990
Take, for instance, diamonds created in laboratories.

453
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,830
They purport to have value, but they're neither natural nor red.

454
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:41,830
What honest woman wants a falsehood on her finger? One of the great truths

455
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,070
left is the power behind a natural Gem.

456
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,190
Real diamonds fill people with passion.

457
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,720
As they have four centuries.

458
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,160
That's right.

459
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,000
In fact, Marie Antoinette wore the hope diamond for a single day and a month

460
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,640
later was dragged to the guillotine by some very, as you say, passionate

461
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,320
folks. Marie Antoinette didn't die because of a diamond.

462
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,920
She died because of a monstrous lack of empathy.

463
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,560
Well, and truth is, she never even wore the hope.

464
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,800
People just believe she did.

465
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,280
Really? That's kind of interesting.

466
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,840
So it was not the mob that killed her.

467
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,200
And it was not the guillotine.

468
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
It was a story.

469
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,740
I must not know my own guest list.

470
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,420
Are you in the diamond business? No, no, I'm in the illusion business.

471
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,500
Like you see, for centuries diamonds were worthless until some very smart,

472
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,340
very rich people like Veronica here told us that not only are these little

473
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,700
shards of glass rare, but that no self respecting couple could possibly get

474
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,500
married without one.

475
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,660
No, that one is a good magic trick.

476
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,590
The problem with the trick is all the good ones have a little twist in the

477
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:49,790
tail. Is it you? This one? Me? Of course not.

478
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,870
No, no.

479
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,230
I mean you wouldn't have let me in had I not demonstrated the finest moral

480
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,830
fiber like some of your other guests.

481
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,870
I noticed Luis Preseno, the arms dealer over there.

482
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,750
Hello, sir.

483
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,110
And of course Maria Bortnik.

484
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,350
When starstruck how she manages to mingle while monopolizing her state

485
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,420
media. Perhaps you'd care to reveal yourself.

486
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,380
Then we can apply the same scrutiny to you.

487
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,100
Not just yet.

488
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,820
I'm sorry for interrupting.

489
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,580
That won't be necessary.

490
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,980
Let him eat cake.

491
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,300
Mark Schreiber.

492
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,300
Veronica Vanderburg.

493
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,710
Lets make this quick, shall we? Our auction begins shortly.

494
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,070
I trust you can do me and the heart justice.

495
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,110
Yes. I only have one rule.

496
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,470
What I say goes.

497
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,310
Well. I'm sure I can find my submissive side.

498
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,830
Well, if not, I'll find it for you.

499
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,510
Oh, I like you.

500
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,150
Right this way, darling.

501
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,940
I don't want to be too matte.

502
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,580
Sure, sure.

503
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,900
But I don't like the sides of my nose shining.

504
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,980
Show me.

505
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,859
Excuse me.

506
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:15,460
Can the little fruit fly in my shot please? Shoo, shoo, shoo.

507
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,060
Thank you.

508
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,540
The only thing more valuable than that diamond is my time.

509
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,860
I did my research on you.

510
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,670
Your industry, like mine, is besieged by manufacturer lore.

511
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,710
But you, you bring us beauty as it is.

512
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,670
We're alike in that regard.

513
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,630
We don't sell contrivance, we sell reality.

514
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,990
Well, I would argue that we don't sell at war.

515
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,750
Others buy.

516
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:47,840
See

517
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,920
the diamond.

518
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,560
Take it out.

519
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,840
I bo.

520
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,080
Absolutely not.

521
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,120
The glare in the glass from are the photos.

522
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't tolerate imperfections.

523
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,720
I don't imagine someone is ravishing as Ms.

524
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
Vanderberg does either.

525
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,560
So take it out or find yourself a new photographer.

526
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,890
In truth, I was hoping you'd ask.

527
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,890
I don't remember asking.

528
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,870
There it is.

529
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,750
Beautiful. Working.

530
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,310
Fabulous. Fabulous.

531
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,590
Fabulous. Beautiful.

532
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,710
Yes. We're smiling.

533
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,870
We're having fun.

534
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,510
This is what we came for.

535
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,470
Hold it.

536
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,990
Hold it.

537
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,390
That's the money shot.

538
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,330
Hold it there.

539
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,330
And you, ma', am, are far enough.

540
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,010
I'm just trying.

541
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,570
I'm trying to help.

542
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,770
Her forehead is shinier than the diamond.

543
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:13,850
Do my job.

544
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,410
I don't get bored when it comes to the heart.

545
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,370
You listen to me.

546
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,690
Get. I can walk myself.

547
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,290
Thank you,

548
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,690
Mr. Schraer.

549
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,050
If you're all you purport to be, you should already have what you need.

550
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,370
More than enough.

551
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,490
Thank you.

552
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,130
Excellent.

553
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,460
Well, it's been a pleasure, but I have buyers waiting.

554
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,300
The hell? What happened? I don't know.

555
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,060
Turn signal.

556
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,500
Let's go.

557
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,490
At last, the auction we've all been waiting for.

558
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,010
Now, if you're here tonight, you probably think you've seen everything.

559
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,410
So it is to you that I ask everything.

560
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,770
It's not been seen in person for a quarter of a century.

561
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,820
Still the largest diamond ever discovered.

562
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,540
The Heart.

563
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,700
Congratulations to all of you.

564
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,940
And for getting away with it for so long.

565
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,060
Well, guess what? Climate change doesn't believe in you either.

566
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,260
You tore your fortunes from our Mother Earth, set fire to her skies and your

567
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,140
private jets.

568
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,510
Let her dry with your insatiable young man.

569
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,790
We all want to save the world here, but time is also precious, and you're

570
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,710
wasting mine.

571
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,110
Zip it, Sparkles.

572
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,670
Why don't you stop sucking on plastic straws and suck on this?

573
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,630
Honored guest.

574
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,640
My name is J.

575
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Daniel Atlas.

576
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,240
You may remember me as your personal favorite of the Four Horsemen of Magic.

577
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,880
Now watch closely as I make the famous Heart diamond appear on my palm.

578
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,600
Gee whiz.

579
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,240
He must be as starved for attention as Greenpeace here.

580
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,560
Rest assured that the diamond is completely safe.

581
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,440
Is it, now? A wise man once told me in the mirror, in fact, never assume

582
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,920
you're the smartest person in the room.

583
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,050
Prove it.

584
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,490
Be my guest.

585
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:42,730
All right.

586
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,130
Well, let's see if we can get that case open.

587
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,250
Abracadabra. No.

588
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,130
Alakazam. Wait.

589
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,690
Open sesame.

590
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,330
Still safe with me.

591
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,590
Relax. Relax, Veronica.

592
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,350
Now, as your ads like to remind us, diamonds are forever.

593
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,470
Get to st.

594
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,110
Now you.

595
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,630
Stop him.

596
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,310
Stop him.

597
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,030
Stop him.

598
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,590
Jeff. Hey.

599
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,670
What are you doing here? Saving your ass.

600
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,030
You're welcome.

601
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,790
You got one too.

602
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,150
Hi. I'm June.

603
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,390
Yeah, who's she sorry.

604
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,990
She's with us.

605
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,710
I guess you guys don't care about the environment.

606
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,270
Stronger than you look.

607
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,710
Hey,

608
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,430
hey, hey, hey.

609
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,880
Stop. Don't get this in the way for fake a What now? My car just sent to get

610
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,280
you out of there.

611
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,800
I don't know.

612
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,680
Henley Reeves.

613
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,880
I had so many posters of you.

614
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,320
Okay, I fanboy later.

615
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,040
But it does, you know, it is really nice to see you.

616
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,880
Fanboy later.

617
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,320
We got to go up.

618
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,760
Put your hands up and.

619
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,010
This is some bullshit.

620
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:01,610
What is happening? Beethoven's Concerto in D Major Bullshit, bullshit,

621
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,650
bullshit. Mary.

622
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,010
What the hell was that? Atlas.

623
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,490
I would like to see you hypnotize three dudes in Belgian.

624
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,850
You mean Flemish? Okay, that explains it.

625
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,810
Lovely reunion.

626
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,530
We have to go.

627
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:17,939
Henley Reeves.

628
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,939
Welcome back.

629
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,499
Thanks. And may I say you are okay.

630
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:23,459
Come on, let's go.

631
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,379
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,179
I was paying her a compliment because it was nice to see her and only her.

633
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:29,379
We get it

634
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,219
up there.

635
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,680
Do you see any other people trying to escape?

636
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,620
Was in my hand the whole time.

637
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,340
It never.

638
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,900
They didn't swap the diamond.

639
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,220
They swapped the case.

640
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,500
And you are far enough.

641
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,100
Why don't you stop sucking on plastic straws and suck on this?

642
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,390
Open sesame.

643
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,850
Diamonds are forever the Tubbo.

644
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,010
Yes, ma'.

645
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,850
Am. We're going to make them regret this.

646
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,330
And then some.

647
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,210
Marks drive a Vanity Fair.

648
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,090
What did I miss?

649
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,680
You know, thought it'd be shinier.

650
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,680
Okay. All right.

651
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Give it back.

652
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,680
Oh. Oh.

653
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,120
So slippery.

654
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,000
Heads up.

655
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,120
Okay, don't do that again.

656
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Hey, can I address the infant in the room? Oh.

657
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,520
Who are these guys? These are the wonderful kids that deep faked our show.

658
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,320
What? Yeah.

659
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
You had the cops sent to my house.

660
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,640
You freaked out my kids.

661
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,600
Yeah, sorry.

662
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,400
Sorry about that.

663
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,700
How are the kids, though? How was the whole boring suburban life you left us

664
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,900
for? Hey, relax, man.

665
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
You missed your shot.

666
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,300
See the size of that rock? No.

667
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,980
Let me see that.

668
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,420
Oh. It's no hard diamond, but it's impressive.

669
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,500
I already told you, Danny.

670
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,940
I didn't feel safe trying to escape from a straight jacket hanging upside

671
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,940
down. I was six months pregnant.

672
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,260
Come on.

673
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,660
We would have flipped you right side up at the end.

674
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,500
You'd have been fine.

675
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,100
Come on.

676
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
You guys don't even miss me.

677
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,780
How long did it take you to replace me? An afternoon and the better part of

678
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,460
an evening.

679
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,990
Hey, speaking of, how is Boodle? Are you guys still.

680
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,070
No, she.

681
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,110
She moved to Paris.

682
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,590
I don't know.

683
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,550
She dumped the great J.

684
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,630
Wilder. My God.

685
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,070
I'm sorry.

686
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,710
My apologies.

687
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,070
Don't you need to be on some, like, cruise Ship somewhere humiliating

688
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,790
yourself. Humiliating myself? Yeah.

689
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,510
I make five figures per cruise.

690
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,349
Plus perks.

691
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,350
Plus perks, he said.

692
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:02,830
Plus perks.

693
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,350
And I thought Merrick drinking himself to death in Mexico was depressing.

694
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,790
Ooh, speaking of, I gotta get back to it.

695
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,830
This liver's not gonna destroy itself.

696
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,960
Can we dry dock this thing? Wait, wait, wait.

697
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,160
You're leaving? Well, yeah.

698
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,040
I mean, great catching up.

699
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,640
I don't know what.

700
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,840
See you in another 10.

701
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,720
Nice to meet you, little task poles.

702
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,000
Adios. Yeah, you know what? Well, I'm out of here too.

703
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,320
I have a gig to get to.

704
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,600
Really? They covering your Uber? Signed an NDA.

705
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,560
Can't say a word.

706
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,240
What are you doing? Six handles, none of them opening.

707
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,940
Who do you think you're talking to? Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't really know

708
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,300
what's going on with you guys.

709
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm getting the feeling there's a lot of weird history here and things are a

710
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:42,980
little awkward.

711
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,500
Yeah. You guys, you used to be the Horseman.

712
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,940
I don't get it.

713
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,940
Why did you break up? Ask them.

714
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,860
Ask them why we broke up.

715
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,100
If it was up to me, we wouldn't know

716
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,340
the Eye wanted us to expose a Russian arms dealer.

717
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,540
We really have to live through this.

718
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,720
We may some huge mistakes.

719
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,600
We got sloppy, cocky.

720
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,560
Because of us, Dylan Shrike will never see the outside of a Russian prison

721
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,840
again. Who? Dylan Shrike.

722
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,000
Okay? He's a Horseman.

723
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,320
Come on, do your homework, man.

724
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,920
I'm so sorry, guys.

725
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,960
I had no idea.

726
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,880
Why? He's stuck in there forever.

727
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,600
Which is obviously a tragedy and something I'll never forgive myself for.

728
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,520
Yeah, fine, man.

729
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,600
But it didn't mean you have to quit.

730
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,600
That is only a bummer, guys.

731
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,490
Sorry about that.

732
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:37,450
A bummer? I love the way your generation sums things up so eloquently.

733
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,690
I mean, someone explain to me why these prepubes are even here.

734
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,130
Same reason you are, man.

735
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,050
I wanted a heart.

736
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,290
Well, we got the heart.

737
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,850
What does the aisle want us to do next? No idea.

738
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,690
I know one thing, but you've got a half a billion dollar diamond in your

739
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,650
hands. They're gonna get in touch.

740
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,330
Yeah, probably.

741
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,570
Whoa, wait, wait.

742
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,850
Atlas, can I see your car? Yeah.

743
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,570
Wow. It's a map.

744
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,650
Hey, Atlas, it's your dad.

745
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,450
No, it's.

746
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,570
It's a map.

747
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,850
That only reveals itself when the Horsemen are together.

748
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,810
Bad chance.

749
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,060
Really, dude? I mean, come on.

750
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
The Eye obviously wants you guys to do this.

751
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,620
You're the Horseman.

752
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,700
Start acting like it.

753
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,660
All right.

754
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,500
I suppose Rosa Rito can wait a couple days.

755
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,460
I can try.

756
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,740
To reschedule this gig.

757
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,380
It's not gonna be easy, but I'll figure it out.

758
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,860
I mean, I have kind of missed running for my life and jumping up rooms with

759
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,160
you guys.

760
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,750
Guys. It's good to have you back.

761
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,950
Thanks. Okay, so where is this place?

762
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,950
What are we supposed to be doing here? The eye will let us know.

763
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,470
All right.

764
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,710
What are you doing? Taking a photo.

765
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,710
Please don't do that.

766
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,590
Post photos of the top secret location.

767
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,040
Want to be in it? I don't want to be in.

768
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,880
Could be used for.

769
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,440
For memories.

770
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,160
No, not memories.

771
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,640
Evidence.

772
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
Huh. I've never seen a door like this.

773
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,360
Okay. I can't open it.

774
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,040
You got this, Jack.

775
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,400
Wait. Don't you mean June? Jack's our lockpick.

776
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,320
Whoa. Looks like a little healthy competition.

777
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:36,840
Come on.

778
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,520
This isn't fair.

779
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,550
I've been picking locks since before she was born.

780
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,790
Let me find the keyhole.

781
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,790
Maybe the other side.

782
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,070
You're not inspiring confidence right now, Jack.

783
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,830
He's got it.

784
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:49,910
He's got it.

785
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,750
Feeling rusty.

786
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,870
Don't rush me.

787
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:58,150
When does he start the lock picking? Hey, Jack, I don't think this is a lock

788
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,550
you pick.

789
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,950
I think it's a lock you solve.

790
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:00,830
So

791
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,720
show them how it's done.

792
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:13,160
Oh, you mind if I just figure this out really quickly? Okay.

793
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,000
If you've ever done an escape room, you'd know there are all kinds of

794
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,840
different puzzles.

795
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,120
It's not just about locks and keys.

796
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,700
Whoa. Huh? You might want to update your game.

797
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,410
Hey, Jack.

798
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:33,090
Whoa. But by all means, lead the way.

799
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,650
I think he loosened it for her, ultimately.

800
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,730
Wow. Wow.

801
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,890
What is this place? Magic nerd heaven? P.T.

802
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,850
silver's coffin.

803
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,730
See, guys? Houdini's straight jacket.

804
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:52,810
Yes, it is.

805
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,700
Hey, can I put you in here for old time's sake? No.

806
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,860
No. I thought it was funny.

807
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,300
Thanks a lot.

808
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,980
You want to come in?

809
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,900
Charlie, check this out.

810
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,380
Dude. What is it? Bullet catch.

811
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,340
No way.

812
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:20,360
Yeah.

813
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:28,910
Dead end.

814
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,990
Yeah. Hey, guys.

815
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,550
Dead end.

816
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,950
Or is it?

817
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,150
Oh, my God.

818
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,590
Yeah, it is.

819
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,560
That's weird.

820
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,880
The die should be here.

821
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,600
The ball should be here.

822
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,360
Oh. Well played.

823
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,560
It's nothing.

824
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,080
Four rows.

825
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,680
1, 5, 8, 4.

826
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,814
Is it a code? 1, bucket, 1, 5 minus 4.

827
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:15,170
1584. The discovery of Witchcraft.

828
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,050
It's the first book on stage Magic is when it was published.

829
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,330
But how does he know that? He's basically a computer full of useless

830
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:21,650
information.

831
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,010
Useless?

832
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,340
This is cool.

833
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,100
Unreal. Nice.

834
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,500
Hey, guys.

835
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,340
It's the floor plan of the chateau.

836
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,270
But it's different somehow.

837
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:11,070
Up is down, left is right.

838
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,310
Even the rooms are drinks.

839
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:19,630
My horsemen.

840
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,790
Thaddeus so good to see you.

841
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,550
So good to see you.

842
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:29,240
Dad, can I just check the ring camera and buzz the sim? Now where's the fun

843
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,280
on that? Sir.

844
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,440
Hi, I'm Charlie.

845
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,800
I. I'm such a big fan of yours.

846
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,720
Hi, Charlie.

847
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,000
I've never seen a Luber lens this big in person.

848
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,120
Really? You ain't seen nothing yet.

849
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,520
So you sent the tarot cards? No, no.

850
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,800
I've long since given up such foolishness.

851
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,330
And your collective dysfunction? No, the only magic I do now is for my

852
00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:02,570
grandchildren. Some weeks ago, however, a card did appear on my doorstep,

853
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:09,930
warning me to prepare this chateau for the arrival of seven soon to be

854
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,250
fugitives from the mall.

855
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,610
That tracks.

856
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,610
Yeah. Wait, so why does the Eye want us here? I can only assume that

857
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:22,180
whatever it is they want you to do next is hidden somewhere in these walls.

858
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:28,980
See this chateau? Chateau Roussillon used to be their home.

859
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:36,180
In 1943, the Allies needed military miracles from every source.

860
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,820
They enlisted the aid of some of the most talented magicians of the time.

861
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:49,940
They built a faux city using mud, cardboard, lights, thousands of inflatable

862
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,140
rubber tanks to misdirect the Germans.

863
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,620
The genius of Jasper Maskelyne.

864
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,220
Somebody knows his history.

865
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,740
Wait, so what do the Nazis have to do with the diamond? That I do not know.

866
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,300
But the answer is here somewhere.

867
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,340
We just have to start looking.

868
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,470
Ms. Vanderburg.

869
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,230
Ms. Vanderburg.

870
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,790
How do you respond to the rumors that your company is nothing but a front

871
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,230
for body laundry? The Horsemen are thieves posing as anti capitalist

872
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:26,190
entertainers. And they have unfairly targeted me and my good company.

873
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,270
I challenge anyone who maligns us to look closely at our operations and our

874
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,790
books. And I challenge police to put those magicians back where they belong

875
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:36,590
in the past.

876
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,400
All right, no more questions.

877
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,920
No more questions, please.

878
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,560
Thank you.

879
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,840
Enterprises. It was an inside job.

880
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,120
Thieves knew exactly where the blind spots were.

881
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,130
How's it.

882
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:09,290
Let me guess.

883
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,930
You're the one behind these Horsemen.

884
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,610
In their little stable hands.

885
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:17,490
No. Why would I ask for the diamond and then try to steal it? If I were you,

886
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,050
I'd figure out a way to get it back and fast.

887
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,690
I understand that you and your race team will be in Abu Dhabi later this

888
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,530
week. A perfect neutral ground.

889
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:27,830
I'll bring my evidence.

890
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,500
You bring your hearts.

891
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,700
If you have one.

892
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,820
Have you found them yet? We do have a few leads.

893
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,900
They were seen near the South Art of Belgium.

894
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,460
Now they're saying the Horsemen have been seen in France.

895
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,900
1 hour ago.

896
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,860
The head of the French police owes me.

897
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,340
Just call him and say that I want These Horsemen's heads served up on a

898
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,180
platter. The gendarme will find them.

899
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,110
You sure of it? Patty has told us to look for something.

900
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,110
What do you think it is?

901
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:01,310
Oh, wow.

902
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,070
This is cool.

903
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,910
You are not a big talker.

904
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,590
Oh, sorry.

905
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,830
But you are a big apologizer.

906
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,150
Sorry, I just did it again.

907
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,390
Sorry. I mean, I'm just nervous.

908
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,070
I. I'm.

909
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,230
I'm a big fan of you guys.

910
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:21,680
And I got the cops called up, and I'm really not gonna say it.

911
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,440
You're forgiven.

912
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,840
You guys make the Horseman look good.

913
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,000
If I didn't see you, why weren't you in it? Oh, I just.

914
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,880
I prefer to be behind the scenes.

915
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,800
You know, I design all of our tricks.

916
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,720
Where are we going? I feel like we're lost.

917
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,720
Do you really prefer that, or is that just something you hide behind? What

918
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,000
do you mean? Well, I.

919
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,010
Whoa. For years, I told myself I wanted to be an assistant.

920
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,730
I didn't mind being upstaged by Atlas because he's so brilliant.

921
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,730
But really, I just.

922
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,490
I was afraid.

923
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:58,490
I was afraid to take the spotlight.

924
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,250
Ooh. Thaddeus was right.

925
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,450
Up is down,

926
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,020
upside down room.

927
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,860
Cool. Cool Is nothing impressive to you.

928
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,940
That's why I said cool.

929
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,260
Do you not know what cool means? All right, let's just try to figure out how

930
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:28,900
this room works.

931
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,220
Okay? Yeah,

932
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,110
figured it out.

933
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,630
Of course.

934
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:37,950
That's right.

935
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:38,790
You know everything already.

936
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,830
So, what did I do wrong this time? Ah, nothing.

937
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,110
My apologies.

938
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:43,990
You're amazing.

939
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,030
It's an honor to watch you.

940
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,150
Has anyone ever told you that you're a control freak? Yep.

941
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:49,750
Many times.

942
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,230
Whoa. Hey.

943
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,270
I did figure it out.

944
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,560
Oh, wow.

945
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,640
Gummies kicked in.

946
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,490
I wonder what we're looking for.

947
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:31,850
Anything weird.

948
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,450
This is all weird.

949
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,330
Jesus, look at this.

950
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,970
You know, I have always looked up to you.

951
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,690
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

952
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,730
Before you became a cruise ship magician.

953
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,890
Hey, I also do corporate events.

954
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,570
Oh, no way.

955
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:50,250
I couldn't tell.

956
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,240
So that was a total waste.

957
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,990
What now? One trick, okay? No charm, no gift of gab.

958
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,790
Just one trick.

959
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,910
Dude, I do not have to prove myself to you.

960
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:00,910
I mean, you kind of do.

961
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,510
Show me why the Eye picked you.

962
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:07,550
You know what? Prove to me that you don't need a babysitter.

963
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,150
Oh, what now? You stop performing.

964
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,910
You're done showing off because your misfit friends aren't here.

965
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:14,830
They're my family.

966
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,270
Don't you dare.

967
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,230
I don't have to impress them.

968
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:17,910
All right, fine.

969
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:18,350
Forget it.

970
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:18,920
I just want to you tell.

971
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,430
See what you were capable of when you weren't trying to win cheap applause

972
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,550
But I guess the answer is nothing.

973
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:26,910
All right.

974
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:31,910
Want to see magic trick? See, the problem with you, Atlas, is that you just

975
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,350
like to over complicate things.

976
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,270
Man, it is a lot easier to find a diamond than you think.

977
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:42,190
And to make it disappear.

978
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,710
Nice. Check your pocket.

979
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,510
Really? Yeah.

980
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,300
Hmm, not bad.

981
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,060
Card to impossible location.

982
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,980
Don't play checkers on a chessboard because I'm already five steps ahead of

983
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,860
you. Check your pocket.

984
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,340
Hey, those are priceless antiques.

985
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,900
Yeah. This room is where old relics go to their final resting place.

986
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,820
Yep, you are.

987
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,580
You're probably right, Thaddeus.

988
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,220
But not before they have one last shot, I think.

989
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,930
Glory, what's going on here? Pretty good.

990
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,130
But you should try to do things a little more slow.

991
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,650
Really let your audience enjoy the real magic.

992
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,730
Okay. Wow.

993
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:26,530
Thanks. I've never been great at poker, but is a diamond trumped by a heart?

994
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,010
Oh, there it is.

995
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,010
Nice misdirection.

996
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,810
But let's not forget what this is really about.

997
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,780
Making a jewel disappear.

998
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,580
Let's see this one.

999
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,660
Keep your eye on the prize.

1000
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,580
Round and round they go.

1001
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,820
Where they stop, nobody knows.

1002
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,060
Good as going.

1003
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:46,820
Black art.

1004
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,740
Table's rigged.

1005
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,860
Saw it when I came in.

1006
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,380
Time for a clean escape.

1007
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,260
Oh yeah.

1008
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,740
Where's he going? I know what he's doing.

1009
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,620
Jack in the box.

1010
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,660
That's a trick.

1011
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,780
It's old stuff.

1012
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,510
If I had known he was that easy to get rid of.

1013
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:04,550
Not that easy.

1014
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:08,350
Oh. Okay, enough of the warm up egg.

1015
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,790
Time for the headliner.

1016
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:12,630
I want you to think of one of these cards.

1017
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,150
But don't think of the one you think I want you to think of.

1018
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,390
Got one? Yeah, I got one.

1019
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,390
What was your card? Four of hearts.

1020
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,830
Oh, nice one, Professor.

1021
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,350
I'm impressed.

1022
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:26,870
I'm impressed.

1023
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:28,860
Hey, hey.

1024
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,460
That whiskey is older than you.

1025
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,420
Sorry, boss.

1026
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,300
So sorry.

1027
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,820
Look you guys, I'm not gonna lie.

1028
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,020
This is really cool.

1029
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,380
Really, really cool.

1030
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,060
Go show em.

1031
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:40,140
But I think I just want to make it a little cooler.

1032
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,900
No storm in China.

1033
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,940
There we are.

1034
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,140
Beautiful. I was red, white and winter.

1035
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,530
Guys, Snow is rare in the this part of France.

1036
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,210
But ice? That is just impossible.

1037
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,250
How'd you do a vanish so good? Oh, magician never tells.

1038
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,250
Check mate.

1039
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,450
Face it, Bosca.

1040
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,890
Wisdom and skill overcome youth and arrogance every time.

1041
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:15,770
Thank you.

1042
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,690
Never assume you're the smartest guy in the room.

1043
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:18,380
Prove anything.

1044
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,370
Give me a break, man.

1045
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,370
You didn't prove anything.

1046
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,650
Hey, can I just remind everyone we still haven't figured out why we're even

1047
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,490
in this World War II relic.

1048
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,370
Wait. Jasper.

1049
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,490
Masculine. The.

1050
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,330
The magician who vanquished the Nazis.

1051
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,290
He built fake cities, fake tanks.

1052
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,610
I mean, I wonder.

1053
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,060
Whoa. Oh.

1054
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,020
Oh, wow.

1055
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,660
Oh, my God.

1056
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,340
I was right.

1057
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,060
Hey, Magic 101, man.

1058
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,940
Never act surprised when the trick actually works.

1059
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,060
Sorry.

1060
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:09,890
Oh, my goodness.

1061
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,400
What is all that? Encyclopedia of Nazi War Criminals.

1062
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,960
Which apparently includes Veronica's dad.

1063
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,560
After World War II, surviving Nazis fled around the world.

1064
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:23,280
I'm not an accountant, but looks like Peter Vandenberg got rich cleaning

1065
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,200
their dirty money.

1066
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,600
Yeah, and apparently Veronica took over right where he left off, using his

1067
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,280
criminal network.

1068
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,640
But I don't understand.

1069
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,920
What does the Eye want us to do with this? Well, if I'm not mistaken, the

1070
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,680
Eye wants us to unmask the Vandenbergs, bring down two generations of

1071
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,440
criminals with a single sleight of hand.

1072
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,240
I've read some interesting rumors about the Vandenbergs Online.

1073
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,360
Looks like 15 years ago, Veronica's mom killed herself, and a week later,

1074
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,039
their housekeeper's brakes failed.

1075
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,000
Her car crashed.

1076
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,160
She and her son died.

1077
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,320
There was some suspicion of foul play, but nothing was ever proven.

1078
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:02,570
Oh,

1079
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,370
hold on, hold on, hold on.

1080
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,730
Listen closely.

1081
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,850
Split up.

1082
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:18,890
Find a way out.

1083
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,490
Okay. Go, go, go.

1084
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:21,010
He's right.

1085
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:21,930
Everybody split up.

1086
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:54,810
Turn around.

1087
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:55,690
Turn around.

1088
00:57:58,410 --> 00:57:59,690
You heard it, Bosco.

1089
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,050
Turn around.

1090
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:11,690
Here they come.

1091
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:19,310
It.

1092
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,810
Sorry. Bonjour.

1093
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:14,300
Bonjour. You know, normally, I like to give a proper tour to new guests.

1094
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,100
I suspect you've discovered that this house holds many secrets.

1095
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:20,700
Thaddeus.

1096
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:36,300
Thaddeus. Would you like to see a magic trick, Sekou? So how about if I make

1097
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,610
myself disappear?

1098
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:02,850
There.

1099
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:12,530
Hurry. This way, that is.

1100
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,050
Oh, thank God.

1101
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:18,370
Hey, which is the fastest way out of here? Around this bend.

1102
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,490
Yeah, There's a passageway.

1103
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,250
Just follow the cream through the forest.

1104
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:29,130
Oh, no.

1105
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1106
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,170
This can't be happening.

1107
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,330
Come on, Thaddeus, stand up.

1108
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,170
We're gonna go now.

1109
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:34,850
We need to get you help.

1110
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:37,570
Please, stand up.

1111
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,010
You have to stop Veronica Vanderburg.

1112
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,810
We can't do it without you, Thaddeus.

1113
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:46,850
You don't need me.

1114
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,370
But you do need each other.

1115
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:53,170
Never.

1116
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:05,340
I knew when I came here, this was probably my final trick.

1117
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,300
No. Don't let me die in vain.

1118
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,220
There's work to be done.

1119
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,060
Go. Go now.

1120
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,660
Go. Please, before us.

1121
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,840
We gotta go.

1122
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,610
The police took June into custody.

1123
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,610
Well, what about Jack and Mary? Them two? Okay, so we break him out.

1124
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,290
Well, let's just talk about this for a second.

1125
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,210
What? Listen to me.

1126
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:27,970
We need to be smart.

1127
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,810
No, we gotta get my friend out of jail.

1128
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,450
Look, when you were researching all that stuff about us, you know what

1129
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:36,050
didn't come up? Charlie, and June are my only friends.

1130
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,220
You know what I really love about them? They don't make me feel like an

1131
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,860
asshole. I'm getting you.

1132
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,020
Bosco, listen to me.

1133
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:42,940
Hey. What? One second.

1134
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:43,700
Listen to me.

1135
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,300
You can't.

1136
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,900
Why tell me? They're looking for you, Bosco.

1137
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,780
They're looking for all of us.

1138
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,540
Yes. Yes.

1139
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,620
You're gonna get arrested, too.

1140
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,860
Yes. Shit.

1141
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,220
Exactly. If only there was somebody else crazy enough to stage a jailbreak

1142
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,260
with no resources, no protection atlas.

1143
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,140
Yeah, maybe there is.

1144
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,750
Thaddeus Marcus Bradley.

1145
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:24,790
In case you're interested in the name of the man you just murdered.

1146
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,270
Ah, yes.

1147
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,160
That was unfortunate.

1148
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,480
You know, when this whole thing started, I didn't give a shit about you or

1149
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,440
your diamond.

1150
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,240
But you just went and made it deeply personal.

1151
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,680
And now I am really looking forward to taking you down.

1152
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,240
My father would have loved you.

1153
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,640
He was quite fond of magic.

1154
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,920
When I was 5 or 6, in one of the few moments that I had him to myself, he

1155
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,880
taught me a trick.

1156
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:03,000
He would make a red silk handkerchief disappear and then come back out of

1157
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,480
his mouth.

1158
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,360
I loved.

1159
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,040
Had just the right amount of flair.

1160
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,000
And I practiced that trick for months.

1161
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:17,600
I thought that if I could do it just right, I would earn more of him.

1162
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,480
But that was the illusion.

1163
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,090
I've hated magic ever since.

1164
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:25,410
The camp, the cheese.

1165
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:30,370
Not to say anything of con artists like you with your mentalism.

1166
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:35,260
Neither one of us has psychic powers, Mr.

1167
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,810
McKinney. You don't have to.

1168
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,810
You know where my heart is.

1169
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:43,410
And I don't have to because you're going to tell me.

1170
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:48,730
I think you're smart enough to know that I ain't telling you shit.

1171
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,490
As we say it, Texas.

1172
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,130
And you're wrong about mentalism.

1173
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:57,050
People wear their entire life story on their face.

1174
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:59,930
You just have to know how to read it.

1175
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,570
Take yours, for example.

1176
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,770
May I? With pleasure.

1177
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:08,890
This is gonna be fun.

1178
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:16,880
Well, you've already shared in excruciating detail your daddy issues, but

1179
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,280
I'm curious about your mom.

1180
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:30,400
Why did she commit suicide? Was she as desperate for your father's attention

1181
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,120
as you were? Oh, she was.

1182
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:44,330
And why was that? Did your father give his attention to someone else? When

1183
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:47,450
you tuck your hair behind your ear, that's a tell.

1184
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:49,850
He was.

1185
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:57,290
So was he banging his secretary? No, that's too cliche.

1186
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,890
But it had to be someone close to your mom for her.

1187
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,530
To a good friend.

1188
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:12,020
Hairdresser. It wasn't the housekeeper, was it? No.

1189
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,940
Not the housekeeper.

1190
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,100
I don't have time for this.

1191
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,340
And that's what people usually say when I'm Getting hot.

1192
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:25,540
Should we crank up the ac? Maybe open a window? Now, if my dad was having

1193
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:31,780
sex with my housekeeper and my mom found out and committed suicide, I

1194
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:37,020
probably wouldn't and cut the brakes on my housekeeper's car.

1195
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,940
But then again, I'm not a psychopath.

1196
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,660
You are a sad and pathetic man.

1197
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,700
I can see why you want to end it.

1198
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,020
Hey, Veronica.

1199
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,020
You know, walking away is also a tell.

1200
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:49,950
Come on.

1201
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,070
If you don't.

1202
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:48,690
Bonsoir.

1203
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,250
It's pretty disgusting, even for you.

1204
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,530
I think I may have overdone it on the wine.

1205
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:05,810
Hi, Lola.

1206
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:07,700
You look great, by the way.

1207
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:12,809
Okay. I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

1208
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:16,249
How'd you find us? A little bird.

1209
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:16,969
You told me.

1210
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:19,209
Imagine my surprise.

1211
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,929
You guys all got back together without me.

1212
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:23,489
What? No, it's not like that.

1213
01:09:23,489 --> 01:09:24,169
You don't understand.

1214
01:09:24,169 --> 01:09:25,369
Oh, was it? No.

1215
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:27,049
You're Free Dick.

1216
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:32,089
The cavalry.

1217
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,160
Miss me? A lot.

1218
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,240
Oh, hello there.

1219
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,400
It's me, Lula.

1220
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,720
Teeth. Lula.

1221
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,760
Remember? I too was once a Horseman.

1222
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,080
Yeah, I asked about you.

1223
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:44,960
I was the only one.

1224
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:45,800
You were the.

1225
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,800
He was the only one.

1226
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,480
Really hurt.

1227
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:49,920
And move.

1228
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,720
We have to get to the.

1229
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,120
Meet him.

1230
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,010
Okay, okay, here's a plan.

1231
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:01,050
I have the getaway car.

1232
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:01,850
It's all ready to go.

1233
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,290
I just need Jack to hotwire it.

1234
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,690
Your plan is for me to steal the car? Uh huh.

1235
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:07,850
Okay. I'll hot wire the car, you get tuned.

1236
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:08,730
Do not leave without it.

1237
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:08,930
All right.

1238
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:09,610
Meet us outside.

1239
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:10,970
Okay. Oh.

1240
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:13,050
Watch for flashing lights.

1241
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:15,610
Okay. You know, I can hot wire them.

1242
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,430
You can let go of me now.

1243
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:40,550
Right, sorry.

1244
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:23,710
Come here.

1245
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:28,750
Where is the diamond? Thank you.

1246
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:30,510
Got your back, you know.

1247
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,830
But who's got yours? Flashing lights.

1248
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:36,990
Run.

1249
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:47,000
Look into my eyes Watch and wonder why I whisper words of weak in your will

1250
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,760
and sleep.

1251
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,120
Not everyone's acceptable.

1252
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,280
I said,

1253
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,440
is it a super play?

1254
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,130
Hello? Jack.

1255
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:39,170
You know, you could have told us you were coming at a police car.

1256
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,130
Thank you very much.

1257
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:42,570
And look, we made the fifth Horseman reappear.

1258
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:43,370
Hello? Lula.

1259
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,330
Hi. Okay.

1260
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:47,850
Are you okay? Yeah, no, I'm okay.

1261
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:48,450
I'm okay.

1262
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:50,770
But they have merit.

1263
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:52,570
Yeah, I escaped.

1264
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:53,250
He. He couldn't.

1265
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,010
Yeah, yeah, very emotional time for everybody here.

1266
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,090
Clearly a lot going on.

1267
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:01,190
I'm. I'm really trying not to take any of this personally, but please,

1268
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:06,140
please, can you tell me, did the eye contact you directly? Yeah.

1269
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,620
You too? Yes.

1270
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,980
Well, why didn't you call me sooner? I'm so sorry.

1271
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,340
I had to find a babysitter.

1272
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,580
Everything happened like that.

1273
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,260
Wait, sorry.

1274
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:17,500
You two know each other? Yeah, we know how many female magicians do you

1275
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,620
think there are in the world? I.

1276
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:21,180
The fact there are three of us in the room right now, it's, like, shocking.

1277
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:21,820
Mind blown.

1278
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:22,340
That's true.

1279
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,780
I'm surprised the universe isn't folding in on itself.

1280
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,540
Exactly. Abu Dhabi.

1281
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:28,710
Just do that.

1282
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:30,030
Sorry, I didn't.

1283
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,750
I'm a big fan of yours, by the way.

1284
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:35,030
I was trying to figure out where Veronica was going to be next, and

1285
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:38,710
apparently Vanderburg Global has a motorsports team.

1286
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:43,030
They're introducing a new car this weekend in Abu Dhabi.

1287
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,390
So we can get Merit back and expose her.

1288
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:45,910
No, no, no.

1289
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:46,750
I am not exposing her.

1290
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,430
I am not exposing anyone, okay? I don't care what the Eye wants.

1291
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,990
No, we are swapping this for Merit, and then we are done.

1292
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,790
We're saving our friends.

1293
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,580
We're not saving the world.

1294
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:57,220
Then what? We just go back to our lives and let her walk away? After Russia,

1295
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:00,020
you said magicians are entertainers, not superheroes.

1296
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,500
And I'm starting to think that you were right.

1297
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,380
She doesn't just launder money like her father.

1298
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,940
You saw what happened at Thaddeus.

1299
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,100
Obviously, I'm playing a bit of catch up here.

1300
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,660
Right? I don't have all of the information, but I don't think that that

1301
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,180
should stop me from having an opinion about what we do next.

1302
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,660
Exactly. No, it shouldn't.

1303
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:17,420
Atlas and I think we should expose Vanessa.

1304
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,770
Veronica. Veronica.

1305
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,880
For murder and what is laundering and for money laundering.

1306
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,640
For murder and for money laundering.

1307
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:24,960
Tie her up.

1308
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,720
No. No.

1309
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,320
It is too dangerous.

1310
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,600
And Atlas is right.

1311
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,120
What? We are done sacrificing ourselves.

1312
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:30,480
I'm sorry.

1313
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,000
It's not worth it.

1314
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,800
That's bullshit.

1315
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,720
What? You're wrong.

1316
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,240
Am I sorry? No, don't be sorry.

1317
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:37,720
Say it.

1318
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:39,800
You are.

1319
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:40,680
You're wrong.

1320
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:47,210
It's just, before I discovered the Horsemen, I didn't give a shit about

1321
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,730
anything. My family gave me up.

1322
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,730
I hated the whole world.

1323
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:59,170
And then I saw a video of you guys, and you were trying to make the world

1324
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:03,570
less corrupt, less terrible.

1325
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:08,370
And that made me give a shit.

1326
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,020
So what's the trick?

1327
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,460
I promise this is gonna work.

1328
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:28,180
But is that enough misdirection? As long as she's here and not there, we can

1329
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:28,660
take care of that.

1330
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,020
If you're even just five minutes late.

1331
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,380
Five? I'd say one.

1332
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,100
One minute late.

1333
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,510
How do we know enough people are gonna show up? You guys is already viral.

1334
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,550
I guarantee there'll be a crowd.

1335
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:39,190
This is nuts.

1336
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,030
There's too many variables.

1337
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:42,670
Hey, we'll be in constant contact with you if something goes awry.

1338
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:45,230
Yeah, there's like no margin for error here, man.

1339
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:45,950
Okay? Zero.

1340
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:48,750
We are going to have to be absolutely flawless if we're going to pull

1341
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:52,070
something this risky off with this many moving parts in this ridiculously

1342
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,750
short amount of time.

1343
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:53,870
Okay? Yes.

1344
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:57,630
Yeah. But speaking for myself, at least I think the seven of us have a

1345
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:58,430
better chance than most.

1346
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:06,210
Would you look at this? When did the great Boscolaroi go soft? Okay, guys,

1347
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:12,650
are we doing this or What? Is a 10 million to one shot? Those are my kind of

1348
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:12,970
odds.

1349
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:25,210
Ladies and gentlemen.

1350
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:26,570
The time has come.

1351
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,460
Tonight, for one night only.

1352
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:31,540
Come in close.

1353
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:38,180
Closer. Cuz the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you.

1354
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:39,860
The countdown begins.

1355
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,460
In only two hours, the Four Horsemen will be on stage together for the first

1356
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,940
time in 10 years.

1357
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,820
J. Daniel Atlas.

1358
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,070
Henley Reeves,

1359
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:02,270
Jack Wilder

1360
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:08,509
And Luma May.

1361
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,270
Ladies and gentlemen.

1362
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:15,870
The Four Horsemen.

1363
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,050
That's right, the Horsemen are back.

1364
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,480
For one night only.

1365
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,360
Last week we stole the Heart Diamond.

1366
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,840
And tonight, in two hours time, we're gonna return it to its rightful owner.

1367
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,040
All of you.

1368
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,960
You think that got her attention? If that didn't, I don't know what will.

1369
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:34,520
All right, listen.

1370
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,240
Now that you know how bad things can actually get, can you please just try

1371
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,760
playing it safe this one time? No.

1372
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,820
Okay. Oh, here she is.

1373
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:44,530
Right on time.

1374
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:48,610
You enjoying the show? It's a little tacky for my taste.

1375
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:52,370
I assume you chose your venue for its proximity to my own.

1376
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,370
Well, good news for you.

1377
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:56,290
I've placed you on our guest list.

1378
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,370
Bring me my heart.

1379
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,370
We'll make an exchange.

1380
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,850
Mr. McKinney for the diamond.

1381
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:07,730
Outside, under the lights and not the first hint of magic.

1382
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:12,260
One rabbit comes out of a hat, One ace slides out of a sleeve.

1383
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:15,140
And your friend goes poof.

1384
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,500
Just trying to use pollen so you'll understand.

1385
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:46,830
Welcome to the W.

1386
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,790
Yas island, the Orlando of the Middle East.

1387
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:58,190
Now, finally, thank you to Yas island for hosting an event worthy of the

1388
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,870
fastest team in motorsport.

1389
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,050
This track is elite.

1390
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,880
But it will soon provide our competitors with the most common view in

1391
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,080
racing. The rear wings of our cars.

1392
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,760
Holy shit, that's Veronica.

1393
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,200
She has a very commanding presence.

1394
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,840
Our magical friends have arrived.

1395
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,920
Why don't you go and greet them? Thank you so much for coming.

1396
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,240
I hope you enjoy the race.

1397
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,560
Okay, Atlas said to create a distraction.

1398
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,290
How are we going to pull this off? There is security everywhere.

1399
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,410
Okay, you guys, calm down.

1400
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:34,010
I got this.

1401
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,170
Hello? Hi.

1402
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,090
David. Cool.

1403
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:38,970
I'm from Media Relations.

1404
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:40,010
I was just checking in.

1405
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:43,490
Do you think you guys could do a different camera placement? Okay, thanks.

1406
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:46,170
Continue your turn.

1407
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:48,490
Let's do this.

1408
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:52,890
Make sure you confirm the authenticity of the diamond.

1409
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,060
These people are very tricky.

1410
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,380
I'm so glad you came.

1411
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:01,700
What did you say? We bury the hatchet in each other's necks? He's funny.

1412
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,580
We each possess something beneficial to the other.

1413
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,420
Perfect reason to do business.

1414
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,980
Only there's one caveat.

1415
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,299
I fervently hope our mutual dealings are.

1416
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:11,220
Out of clothes.

1417
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,420
She's so poor.

1418
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,540
I hate her.

1419
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:19,100
How's it going? Well, can I help you? Yeah, we're here to shoot the car, I

1420
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,350
think. Oh, right.

1421
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:20,910
Of course.

1422
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:23,790
Obviously. There you are, you.

1423
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:25,630
It's my jacket.

1424
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:29,310
Somewhere. There it is.

1425
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,550
We're with checkered flags.

1426
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:31,270
The DOC Series.

1427
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,710
Next season's on Vandenberg Motorsports.

1428
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,510
It seriously didn't give you guys a heads up? Typical.

1429
01:20:35,709 --> 01:20:38,230
We're just gonna get some inserts, maybe some B roll.

1430
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:40,350
And some party people gawking at this beauty.

1431
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:41,710
All right, whenever you're ready.

1432
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:41,950
All right.

1433
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:42,830
Don't touch the car.

1434
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:43,990
We gotta shoot the interior.

1435
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:45,920
Yeah, I can actually get you a cameo in this thing.

1436
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,600
Save it.

1437
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,720
I've got my orders.

1438
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,840
Yeah, and so do we.

1439
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,760
Good evening, Ms.

1440
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,560
Vanderberg. Yeah, we're trying to get that footage you asked for, but we ran

1441
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,720
into a little bit of a problem.

1442
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,320
You're going to be in trouble.

1443
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,360
She wants to talk to you.

1444
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,400
It's not good.

1445
01:20:59,400 --> 01:20:59,960
My guy.

1446
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:00,920
Not good.

1447
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:07,000
Hello. Listen, my father always said no imp sat unseen.

1448
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,520
And at this very moment, my car is the diamond.

1449
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:15,330
So you can either let them do their job or you can find yourself a new one.

1450
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:16,730
Sorry for the.

1451
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:17,330
Hold on, man.

1452
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:21,170
You're good.

1453
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:22,370
You're the best.

1454
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:24,850
You could just back up for me really quick, just for the light.

1455
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:25,570
Thanks, man.

1456
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:34,250
Well, shall we get on with it, please? Oh, of course.

1457
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:34,850
You have a goon.

1458
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:35,490
Forgive me.

1459
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:38,500
Come on.

1460
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,300
You don't trust us? After all we've been through?

1461
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:48,780
Is there a problem? Double check if you're not certain it's the heart.

1462
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,500
Yes, of course it is.

1463
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,820
Now, please, can you get our friend.

1464
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,060
Come on.

1465
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,220
There he is.

1466
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,950
Okay. Hey.

1467
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:07,910
You okay? Well, now that I know I'm worth half a billion.

1468
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:09,190
I still think we got ripped off.

1469
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:09,990
But it's good to see you.

1470
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:11,670
Signed, sealed, delivered.

1471
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,350
See? I'm a woman of my word.

1472
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:15,350
Stick around if you want.

1473
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,390
Enjoy the party.

1474
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,670
What a God's name.

1475
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:26,630
Come on.

1476
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:30,150
How do you make this thing go? How? They know I can't concentrate with you

1477
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,110
yelling at me?

1478
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:35,670
Excuse me?

1479
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,870
You join the show.

1480
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,590
You just got to stand there, Ging, or get my car back.

1481
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:47,190
You did this.

1482
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:53,110
Okay, here we go.

1483
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:57,870
Okay. Atlas, you wanted a distraction, you got a distraction.

1484
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,430
And this thing's tail hatch,

1485
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:14,230
we fell through trap door or something.

1486
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,870
Is everybody okay? Where are.

1487
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,520
When I woke up this morning, there was only one thing I wanted more than my

1488
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,480
diamond. My horseman under lock and key.

1489
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:30,680
And now that I have both, I must admit, I'm feeling a little bit spoiled.

1490
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:35,240
While you were prepping your little performance, I curated a trick of my

1491
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,880
own. Five Horsemen, trapped.

1492
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:38,840
No escape.

1493
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,440
You five may be national treasures, but we have those here, too.

1494
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:47,360
Only they're hard to find because they're buried inside.

1495
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,520
To the world, it will appear you died in a failed escape act.

1496
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,520
Now, let's see some magic.

1497
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,600
Magic. Somebody call for backup.

1498
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,520
Jack, call June.

1499
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,240
Anyone have service? God.

1500
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,840
She must have scrambled the cell signal.

1501
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:09,760
She thought of everything.

1502
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,660
Hula. Whose side are you on? I'm on our side, obviously.

1503
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:13,860
But she also thought of everything.

1504
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,340
Both things can be true at one time.

1505
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,260
Sand is getting higher.

1506
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,380
Sand's getting bigger.

1507
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,100
There's more sand.

1508
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:18,980
And it's getting larger.

1509
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:19,740
Henley. Henley.

1510
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:20,980
First principle of escape.

1511
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,140
How long is this Survivable? Right.

1512
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:23,580
Okay, great.

1513
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,180
Judging from the rate of the flow, the volume of the box.

1514
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:27,500
Yeah, we're screwed.

1515
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,180
Oh, amazing.

1516
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:31,540
Okay, how about the second principle of escape then? Okay, so that's the box

1517
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:34,700
itself. Is there a flaw? Is there a weakness? There a back door? Everybody

1518
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,700
just decent check.

1519
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:39,490
Seal, seal, seal, seal.

1520
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:43,090
Everything sealed.

1521
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:48,330
Each answer.

1522
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:49,250
The third principle.

1523
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,490
I have what you're after.

1524
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:01,730
Perfect. I will meet you where the heart resides.

1525
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,460
I can hardly wait.

1526
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:10,860
Straight to the vault.

1527
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,420
No, no, no, no.

1528
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:19,740
Yes. Help me, Ricky Bobby.

1529
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,460
Help me.

1530
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:28,110
Is this really gonna happen right now? We're just gonna die here? Here in

1531
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:29,550
this box? Really? It's funny.

1532
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:32,790
A week ago, I wanted to die, and.

1533
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:37,190
And then I get my reason to live back, and now we're actually going to die.

1534
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,790
How? How.

1535
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:41,470
How is that funny? Well, I mean, it was funnier in my head.

1536
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,750
It's. You know, it's peculiar.

1537
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,310
Funny. No, no.

1538
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:45,670
We're out of options.

1539
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:48,830
God, I never should have been that horrible about your website and your

1540
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:54,080
costumes and the logo is not embarrassing that the eye and Wilder is a

1541
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:54,840
little magic wand.

1542
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,280
It's not.

1543
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,040
It's cute and it's charming and I missed you.

1544
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,840
Listen, I know I don't always show it, but I really do think the world of

1545
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:04,400
all of you.

1546
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,600
Cannot believe we're getting buried alive.

1547
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,040
I mean, it's like a Westerner.

1548
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,480
Wait, wait.

1549
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,960
Buried alive? That's like an old magic tradition.

1550
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:13,440
Sorry, who.

1551
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,440
Who do we know who did that.

1552
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,600
Bill Shurick nearly died doing that.

1553
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,940
Remember, he got into a plexiglass coffin and had it covered in sand.

1554
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,540
In the plexiglass break, the sand got wet.

1555
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,100
Sand got wet.

1556
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:24,660
I remember now.

1557
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,700
It rained the night before it.

1558
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:27,860
Wet sand is heavier than dry.

1559
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,660
It broke the glass.

1560
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1561
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:33,180
If we broke that pipe, then it would wet the sand, and then it'll.

1562
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:36,980
It'll break the box, right? If I could, I could wrap something around it.

1563
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:38,100
I might be able to get some leverage.

1564
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,740
Okay, Mayor, give me your belt.

1565
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,060
Okay, okay.

1566
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:42,820
You got it, you got it.

1567
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,500
Good, good, good, good, good.

1568
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:44,980
Lock this.

1569
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:45,320
Come on.

1570
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:47,230
This, come on.

1571
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:52,190
Help me.

1572
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:52,470
Help me.

1573
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:53,150
Pull me down.

1574
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,230
Okay, okay.

1575
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:54,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1576
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:06,430
Pull over.

1577
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,110
We have you surrounded.

1578
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:10,970
I'd love to pull over, but I'm finally getting the head.

1579
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:11,680
I did it.

1580
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,760
I'm the greatest driver in the world.

1581
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,400
No, no, no, no.

1582
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,560
Watch out.

1583
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,960
Turn off the engine and exit the vehicle.

1584
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,480
We've got you surrounded.

1585
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,200
Put your hands up and don't move.

1586
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:44,880
I'm sorry.

1587
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,080
Did I forget to use my blinker? You're under arrest.

1588
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,400
Thank you, gentlemen.

1589
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,680
Excellent work.

1590
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,320
We've had a red notice.

1591
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,080
Juan Bosco.

1592
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,840
Leroy. Thank you.

1593
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,400
No problem.

1594
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,760
Yep. Atlas is going to kill me.

1595
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,010
Why? Is coming into too fast and the glass won't break.

1596
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:07,010
I. All this for a diamond? Could use that now.

1597
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:08,530
Nothing cuts glass like a diamond.

1598
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:10,210
Wait, wait.

1599
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:11,370
Henley. Henley.

1600
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:13,930
Yeah. I can hold my breath for eight minutes.

1601
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:16,650
If anyone can get us out of this, we can.

1602
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,860
We're crossing into the desert.

1603
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:42,020
Mount Dust Storm is getting worse.

1604
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,620
What's he doing here? Ms.

1605
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:52,580
Vanderberg's diamond.

1606
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,780
That you and your friend stole.

1607
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,160
Something.

1608
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,380
That was fun.

1609
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:40,740
It's working.

1610
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:41,700
It's working.

1611
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:47,960
It.

1612
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:16,150
Way to go.

1613
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:17,990
All right.

1614
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:19,350
We gotta show the catch.

1615
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,030
Hope we're not too late.

1616
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,120
Identity verified.

1617
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,200
You made it.

1618
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:08,490
Do you have what I want? If you have what I want,

1619
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:14,170
where's the evidence?

1620
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:22,730
Right here.

1621
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:26,010
I'm the evidence.

1622
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:34,580
Ador. You did.

1623
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:38,180
Now you see me.

1624
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:50,020
It's quite fascinating the things people do to make something or someone

1625
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,260
disappear.

1626
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:58,270
Ah.

1627
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:08,190
I taught you that trick.

1628
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,910
Just like our father taught you.

1629
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:14,750
And now, after 15 years, you're.

1630
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:15,990
You're trying to ruin me.

1631
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:23,560
No. All 15 years I didn't know you'd be in that car.

1632
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,400
But you must have been relieved to hear.

1633
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:26,920
I was.

1634
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,200
When we hit the water, I couldn't unbuckle my seat belts.

1635
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,960
Mom freed me with her dying breath.

1636
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:39,960
I had nothing but fondness for you, Charlie.

1637
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,600
Let me finally treat you like a brother.

1638
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,800
I am your Brother.

1639
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,410
Father's blood is in both of us.

1640
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:58,530
Though he'd never acknowledge man, God knows Mother begged.

1641
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:00,970
And the shame drove my mother to her grave.

1642
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:02,850
Then you sent man to hers.

1643
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:08,290
Fine. You're right.

1644
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:12,620
It should be yours.

1645
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:15,570
Was. Here.

1646
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:19,490
Take it.

1647
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,540
Bullet catch.

1648
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,100
It's impossible.

1649
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,180
No. Just magic.

1650
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:08,860
Hello, everyone.

1651
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:11,260
Thank you.

1652
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:13,820
All right, thank you.

1653
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:19,020
Earlier tonight, J janu Atlas promised to return the Heart diamond to its

1654
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:19,980
rightful owner.

1655
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:24,700
But before we do that, some introductions are in order.

1656
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:31,270
First, let's say hello to the fierce force of nature, the extraordinary June

1657
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:31,830
Br.

1658
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:37,430
Hello, everyone.

1659
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:38,390
Thank you.

1660
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:41,110
Thank you so much.

1661
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:41,830
Thank you.

1662
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:46,950
And give it up for the indomitable Bosco Loy.

1663
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:50,470
The pleasure is ours.

1664
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,150
Hello, gorgeous.

1665
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,600
And of course, we could not have done any of this in the first place without

1666
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,360
the help of the world's greatest magicians.

1667
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,640
The four.

1668
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,640
Sorry. Make that five.

1669
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:07,920
Horsewen.

1670
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:21,760
Thank you, everyone.

1671
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:29,080
Wow. You know, we have entertained, well dazzled audiences all over the

1672
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,960
world, but we have never been part of a trick like this.

1673
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:37,600
And you may be asking yourself, how did they pull this off? Okay, well,

1674
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,520
every magician needs an assistant.

1675
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:47,450
Veronica. You may think Veronica here as Peter Vanderburgh's sole heir, is

1676
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,450
the the rightful owner of this diamond.

1677
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:51,050
But here's the twist.

1678
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:52,890
Peter didn't have one child.

1679
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:54,090
He had two.

1680
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,010
That's right.

1681
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:59,690
And that other child cheated death and landed in New York City,

1682
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,370
where vengeance became his life's work.

1683
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:08,810
But he would need help.

1684
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:13,160
So he.

1685
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:13,950
He recruited,

1686
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:28,030
enticed and lord, some of the most brilliant minds he could assemble, laying

1687
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:31,150
the groundwork for a trick unlike any other.

1688
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:35,070
Which brings us to tonight.

1689
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:40,390
Make some noise for the mastermind behind all of this, our best friend.

1690
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:43,030
A ghost until this very moment.

1691
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:45,430
Charlie Vanderberg.

1692
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:57,230
You know, I said I'd enjoy taking you down, but this is more fun than I

1693
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:59,670
anticipate. You are still a sad, empathetic man.

1694
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:01,350
And you are nothing.

1695
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:02,630
Oh, hold on, everyone.

1696
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:03,350
One sec.

1697
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:04,250
And you never will be.

1698
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,600
I don't understand how you pulled this off.

1699
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,720
You don't understand? Veronica doesn't seem to understand how she found

1700
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,000
herself in this position.

1701
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,000
Well, let's explain it to her.

1702
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:21,440
You see, the finest magic preys on assumptions that the car waiting for you

1703
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,360
was the same one that dropped you off.

1704
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,000
Let's go.

1705
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,610
That in act of Mother nature sure is nothing but.

1706
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:47,450
And that a vault in the desert isn't just smoke and mirrors.

1707
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:55,310
That a gun isn't filled with blanks.

1708
01:37:56,900 --> 01:38:00,580
And that an elevator is just simply descending into Earth.

1709
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:06,220
If you want to trick the master of deception, you have to manipulate her.

1710
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:11,940
Reality. And for our last trick, why don't we make Veronica disappear?

1711
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:16,420
You don't win.

1712
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:17,940
I demand you.

1713
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,380
There she is.

1714
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:20,420
Missing her already.

1715
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:21,630
Find final reveal.

1716
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:24,510
The real Veronica Vanderburg.

1717
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:28,190
The world is full of illusions.

1718
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:33,230
One of the biggest is that this diamond belongs to the Vandenbergs at all.

1719
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:39,990
As my father's only unincarcerated next of kin, I'll make sure every one of

1720
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:43,230
our illicit buyers faces legal repercussions.

1721
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:49,440
And then I'll gift all our assets, including the heart, to the South African

1722
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,920
communities they came from.

1723
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,360
With a few extra dollars left for all of you.

1724
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,160
Forceful crowds always leave with deeper pockets.

1725
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,600
Nice trick.

1726
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,960
I learned from the best.

1727
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,320
Thank you.

1728
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,000
Thank you.

1729
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,960
Thank you for joining us.

1730
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:10,920
All of us.

1731
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:17,730
And please remember, no matter what cards life deals you, you have to learn

1732
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:19,890
to make your own magic.

1733
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:23,650
Ladies and gentlemen, we are the Horsemen.

1734
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:37,850
Sa.

1735
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:12,540
All right, what do you want? Pomegranate or boysenberry? Dude, I said I

1736
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,460
wanted a drink.

1737
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:14,900
Let's give it a try.

1738
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,260
Kids today.

1739
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:25,060
Of course.

1740
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:26,420
That's pretty good.

1741
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:27,620
I'm trying now.

1742
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,820
I think you dropped this.

1743
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:32,130
Oh. Card.

1744
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:33,370
Just in case you want to frame it.

1745
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:34,250
Thanks. I might.

1746
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:37,290
You know, I still cannot believe you're a Vanderburg.

1747
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,410
Neither could she.

1748
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:39,770
I was thinking.

1749
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,450
I feel like we should start our own group.

1750
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:42,010
You guys.

1751
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,450
Girls. Magic group.

1752
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:46,090
Yes. Horse girls.

1753
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:48,930
No. Horse women.

1754
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:49,410
Not that.

1755
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,130
Ladies of the horse ponies.

1756
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:52,450
Really bad.

1757
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:57,480
Can I talk to you real quick? Not trying to infiltrate the horsewomen.

1758
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,000
What's up?

1759
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,000
It's just.

1760
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:06,680
Speak. What is the matter with you? It's hard because I don't.

1761
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,560
I don't know how you feel, so.

1762
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,160
Hey, everybody.

1763
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,200
Everybody, come on over here, please.

1764
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,280
Yeah. Come on, guys.

1765
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:21,040
Hey, can you grab some more of those delicious things? Posco? Chad, you are

1766
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,970
gonna love this stuff.

1767
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:24,090
It is flaps.

1768
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:25,010
No merit.

1769
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:25,930
Please. It slaps.

1770
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:27,170
What I meant to say is.

1771
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:27,650
It's good.

1772
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:28,850
Yeah, right? Yes.

1773
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:31,090
And I will be the one to say it.

1774
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:32,330
I am going to miss you guys.

1775
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:35,210
I was just thinking the same thing.

1776
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:36,410
Yeah, me, too.

1777
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:37,730
Damn it.

1778
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:38,570
I love you guys.

1779
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:40,210
We love you, too.

1780
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:40,970
We love you.

1781
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:43,810
You, too.

1782
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:45,170
Wow. Very sweet.

1783
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:47,900
Even me? Really? You must be very drunk.

1784
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:48,340
Whoa.

1785
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,740
Go back to what? We all love each other.

1786
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,660
Go back to that.

1787
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:01,300
You guys expecting someone? No one's supposed to know where we are.

1788
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:20,430
Who's it from? Doesn't say.

1789
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:21,710
Open it.

1790
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:23,310
You open it.

1791
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:24,270
Okay.

1792
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:32,750
Oh, that's the.

1793
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:33,870
That's the thing from the door.

1794
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:34,990
Yeah, from the chateau.

1795
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:35,950
Do you.

1796
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:38,710
You mind if I take another crack at it? Yeah, go for it.

1797
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:42,190
Yeah, I think I can handle it this time.

1798
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,150
Hello, Horseman.

1799
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:02,270
Did you miss me? Dylan.

1800
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,320
But he's supposed to be imprisoned.

1801
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,080
I know what you're thinking.

1802
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,120
He lied to us.

1803
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:08,880
But I.

1804
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,920
I didn't lie to you.

1805
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,360
I just led you to believe something that wasn't true.

1806
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,120
But it was for your own good.

1807
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:14,840
Trust me.

1808
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,400
There's more to this mystery than you realize.

1809
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:21,000
And the end result is that the Horsemen are back together again.

1810
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,120
It warms my heart.

1811
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,040
Now for you three imposters.

1812
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:31,490
Brazenly pretending like you're part of our top secret organization.

1813
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:35,970
You think you're gonna get away with it with no consequences or

1814
01:43:35,970 --> 01:43:40,930
repercussions. Well, you thought right.

1815
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:45,010
Welcome. Welcome to the Eye.

1816
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:51,250
As for the rest of you, you thought your work was done.

1817
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,370
Thank you, Genti.

1818
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,020
You're just getting stone.

1819
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:01,660
What's the trick.
